# Student Management System

A simple console-based Student Management System developed in Java. This project helps understand core Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as classes, objects, constructors, and ArrayLists, along with file structuring and user input handling.

## Features

- Add new students with name, roll number, course, and email
- Remove students using their roll number
- Display all students
- Console-based interactive menu system

## Technologies Used

- **Java** – Core language for logic and structure
- **ArrayList** – For managing student records
- **Scanner** – For handling user input via the console

## File Structure

- `Main.java` – Entry point of the program; handles user interaction
- `Student.java` – Contains the `Student` class with attributes and display method
- `StudentManager.java` – Manages student data (add, remove, display)

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Compile all `.java` files:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
